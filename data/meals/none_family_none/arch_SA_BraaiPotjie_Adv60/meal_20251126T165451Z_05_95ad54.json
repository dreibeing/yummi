  "name": "Snoek Braai with Chutney-Honey Glaze, Coal-Baked Potatoes, and Grilled Corn",
  "description": "Whole snoek grilled over medium coals with a glossy chutney-honey glaze, served with coal-baked potatoes and charred corn. A classic South African braai centerpiece with balanced medium heat.",
  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F).",
    "Scrub 4 large potatoes; pat dry.",
    "Peel and finely mince garlic.",
    "In a bowl, whisk chutney, honey, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, chilli flakes, a pinch of salt, and black pepper to make the glaze.",
    "Pat snoek dry with paper towels; sprinkle both sides lightly with salt and black pepper.",
    "Trim corn of any loose husk/silk; leave a thin layer of husk if present or keep bare for faster charring.",
    "Chop parsley for garnish.",
    "Light the braai and build a medium bed of coals with a cool zone; clean and oil the grill grates."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Bake potatoes on an oven rack for 45 minutes until starting to soften.",
    "Move potatoes to the braai: wrap each in foil if you prefer tidier skins (optional), then place at the edge of the coals; turn every 10 minutes until fully tender, 20–30 minutes.",
    "Place snoek skin-side down on an oiled grill over medium heat (cooler side if the fire is hot). Close the lid or cover loosely; grill 6–8 minutes.",
    "Brush snoek generously with the chutney-honey glaze. Continue grilling 6–10 minutes, brushing once more, until the thickest part just flakes and the glaze is tacky. Avoid direct flames to prevent burning.",
    "Grill corn over medium heat, turning every 2–3 minutes until charred in spots and tender, 10–12 minutes.",
    "Split potatoes; add butter and a pinch of salt and black pepper.",
    "Rest snoek 3 minutes off heat. Brush with any remaining warm glaze.",
    "Plate snoek with baked potatoes and grilled corn. Sprinkle parsley over the fish and potatoes. Serve immediately."
