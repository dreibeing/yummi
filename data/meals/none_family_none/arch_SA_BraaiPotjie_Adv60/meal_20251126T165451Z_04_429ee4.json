  "name": "Beef Short Rib Potjie with Butternut and Oven-Warmed Rolls",
  "description": "A slow-cooked South African potjie of beef short ribs layered with root veg and butternut, simmered over coals and finished with a rich tomato-beef stock gravy. Serve with oven-warmed bread rolls to mop up the sauce.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Prepare a steady bed of medium coals on the outdoor grill; you’ll cook the potjie over gentle, consistent heat.",
    "Peel and roughly chop onions.",
    "Peel and cut carrots into thick chunks.",
    "Peel potatoes and cut into large chunks.",
    "Peel and cube butternut squash into large pieces.",
    "Crush or finely chop garlic.",
    "Measure crushed tomatoes and beef stock; keep bay leaves and spices ready.",
    "Set oven to 160°C (320°F) to warm bread rolls later."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Set a potjie/Dutch oven over the coals and heat sunflower oil until shimmering.",
    "Season beef short ribs generously with salt and black pepper.",
    "Brown beef short ribs in batches, turning to color all sides; remove to a tray.",
    "Add onions to the pot; cook until softened and lightly golden.",
    "Stir in garlic, paprika, ground cumin, and lightly crushed coriander seeds; cook 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Return beef to the pot with any juices. Add crushed tomatoes, beef stock, bay leaves, and a pinch of chilli flakes for medium heat. Bring to a gentle simmer.",
    "Layer carrots over the meat, then potatoes, then butternut squash. Do not stir; keep layers intact.",
    "Cover with lid. Cook over low, steady coals for 2–2.5 hours, adjusting coals to maintain a gentle bubble. Rotate the pot occasionally for even heat.",
    "After 2 hours, check tenderness. If the liquid is low, top up with a splash of beef stock and re-cover. Cook until ribs are tender and vegetables are soft.",
    "Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper. Gently tilt the pot to mix some sauce through without breaking the layers.",
    "During the last 10 minutes, place bread rolls on a tray and warm in the oven until soft and heated through.",
    "Serve the potjie hot with the oven-warmed bread rolls for dipping."
