  "name": "Smoked Braai Brisket with Pap and Chakalaka Relish",
  "description": "Low-and-slow braai-smoked beef brisket finished tender in the oven, served with maize meal pap and a quick chakalaka relish. A classic South African feast built for weekend project cooking.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Soak a generous load of braai wood per your grill/smoker instructions; prepare a two-zone fire (hot and cool side).",
    "Preheat OutdoorGrill to 120–135°C (250–275°F) indirect and Oven to 150°C (300°F).",
    "Trim excess surface fat from beef brisket, leaving a 5–8 mm cap.",
    "In a bowl, mix braai spice mix (3 tbsp), paprika (1 tbsp), salt (2 tsp), and black pepper (2 tsp). Rub all over brisket and rest 20 minutes at room temperature.",
    "Stir together mop sauce: apple cider vinegar (1/2 cup), BBQ sauce (1/3 cup), olive oil (1 tbsp), chilli flakes (1 tsp), garlic powder (1 tsp).",
    "Dice onion (1 large) and bell peppers (2).",
    "Measure chakalaka (2 cups) and set aside.",
    "Measure maize meal (2 cups) and chicken stock (6 cups). Keep extra salt ready."

  "cook_steps": [
    "Place brisket fat-side up on the grill’s cool zone. Close lid; stabilize at 120–135°C (250–275°F). Feed braai wood as needed for clean smoke.",
    "Smoke for 3 hours, mopping lightly every 45 minutes. Maintain gentle, clean smoke and steady temperature.",
    "Transfer brisket to an oven-safe roasting dish with a lid. Add 1/4 cup mop to the dish, cover, and move to the Oven at 150°C (300°F).",
    "Braise-roast 2–3 hours until a probe slides in with little resistance (target internal 93–96°C / 200–205°F). Rest covered 30 minutes off heat.",
    "While brisket finishes, make chakalaka relish: set a pan over StoveTop medium heat with 1 tbsp olive oil. Sauté onion 4 minutes, add bell peppers and cook 4 minutes more.",
    "Stir in chakalaka and a pinch of salt; simmer 5–8 minutes to meld. Hold warm on low.",
    "Cook pap: bring chicken stock to a boil on StoveTop. Rain in maize meal while whisking. Reduce to low, cover, and cook 20–25 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes until thick and smooth. Season with salt to taste and 1 tbsp olive oil.",
    "Slice brisket across the grain into 5–10 mm slices. Brush with remaining warm mop or a little BBQ sauce if desired.",
    "Plate sliced brisket with generous spoonfuls of pap and chakalaka relish. Serve immediately."
