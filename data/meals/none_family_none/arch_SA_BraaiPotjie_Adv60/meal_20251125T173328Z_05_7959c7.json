  "name": "Picanha Braai with Chimichurri, Grilled Corn, and Oven Roosterkoek",
  "description": "Fat-cap-on picanha cooked over a two-zone braai for a juicy roast, served with bright chimichurri, flame-kissed corn, and oven-baked roosterkoek. An advanced, slow, weekend-style South African-Latin American mashup.",
  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Light the OutdoorGrill for two-zone cooking: one hot direct side and one cooler indirect side.",
    "Pat dry the picanha steak; score the fat cap in a shallow crosshatch.",
    "Mix braai spice mix, chilli flakes, salt, black pepper, and 1 tbsp olive oil into a paste; rub all over the picanha. Rest at room temperature 20–30 minutes.",
    "Shuck corn and remove silk; rub with 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt.",
    "In a bowl, combine roosterkoek mix and warm milk to form a soft dough; knead 8–10 minutes until smooth.",
    "Lightly oil a bowl, set dough in, cover, and proof in a warm spot until doubled, 45–60 minutes.",
    "Preheat Oven to 200°C (392°F) with a baking tray inside.",
    "Punch down dough, divide into 8 even balls, and place on a parchment sheet for a 10-minute bench rest.",
    "Melt butter for brushing."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Set the picanha fat-side down over indirect heat. Close the lid and cook 30–45 minutes, turning once, until internal temp reaches about 48–50°C (118–122°F).",
    "Move picanha to the hot direct side, sear 2–3 minutes per side to crisp the fat and build color (watch for flare-ups). Rest on a board 10–15 minutes.",
    "While the meat rests, grill the corn over direct heat 8–12 minutes, turning until charred in spots and tender. Brush with a little olive oil if dry and season with salt.",
    "Slide the rested dough balls onto the hot baking tray and bake in the Oven 15–20 minutes until puffed and golden. Brush immediately with melted butter.",
    "Slice the picanha across the grain into thick slices.",
    "Serve sliced picanha with chimichurri spooned over, grilled corn on the side, and warm roosterkoek."
