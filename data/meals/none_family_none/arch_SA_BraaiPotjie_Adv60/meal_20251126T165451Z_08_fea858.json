  "name": "Boerewors Coil Braai with Tomato Sheba, Coal-Baked Potatoes, and Charred Corn",
  "description": "A classic South African boerewors braai with a rich, medium-heat tomato-onion sheba, coal-baked potatoes, and charred corn. Weekend project with hands-on fire management and slow sides.",
  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Light the braai with braai wood and build a two-zone fire (hot side and cooler side). Let coals burn to medium heat.",
    "Scrub 4 potatoes and pat dry. Prick each a few times with a fork and rub with 1 tbsp olive oil and a big pinch of salt.",
    "Shuck 4 corn and rub with 1 tbsp olive oil; season with salt and a pinch of black pepper.",
    "Dice 2 onions. Chop 6 tomatoes. Mince 3 cloves garlic.",
    "Measure 1 tsp chilli flakes, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, and 1 tsp brown sugar for the sheba.",
    "Coil 1.2 kg boerewors into a neat spiral and secure with two skewers to hold its shape.",
    "Set a medium saucepan on the stovetop for the sheba; keep a braai-safe pan ready if you prefer to keep it on the fire."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Bake the potatoes: Nestle the oiled, salted potatoes in medium-hot coals (or place just at the edge of the hot zone). Turn every 15 minutes until skins are charred and centers are tender, 60–75 minutes.",
    "Start the sheba (stovetop): Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add diced onions with a pinch of salt; cook until soft and lightly golden, 8–10 minutes.",
    "Add minced garlic and 1 tsp chilli flakes; stir 30 seconds. Add chopped tomatoes, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, and 1 tsp brown sugar. Season with salt and black pepper.",
    "Simmer the sheba on low, stirring occasionally, until thick and jammy, 25–35 minutes. Adjust salt and heat to taste, then keep warm.",
    "Grill the corn: Place corn over medium-hot coals. Turn every 2–3 minutes until lightly charred all over and tender, 10–12 minutes. Season with salt and a pinch of black pepper; keep warm on the cooler side.",
    "Braai the boerewors: Place the coil on the cooler side (indirect heat). Cover the braai (or use a lid) and cook 10–12 minutes. Move to the hot side to brown, 3–4 minutes per side, until cooked through and juices run clear.",
    "Rest the boerewors 5 minutes. Slice into lengths.",
    "Serve: Split baked potatoes, fluff, and top with a spoon of warm sheba. Plate boerewors with extra sheba and charred corn. Garnish with chopped coriander if desired."
