  "name": "Braaied Lamb Chops with Oven Pap Tart, Chakalaka, and Mint Yoghurt",
  "description": "Flame-grilled lamb chops finished with a cool mint yoghurt, served alongside a cheese-topped oven pap tart and warm chakalaka. A classic South African braai with a Greek-leaning sauce touch.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Light a medium-hot braai fire; allow coals to form.",
    "Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F). Grease a medium baking dish.",
    "Trim excess fat from lamb chops if needed. Pat dry.",
    "In a bowl, combine olive oil, crushed garlic, chopped rosemary, chilli flakes, salt, and black pepper. Rub over lamb chops and marinate 20–30 minutes.",
    "Finely chop the onion.",
    "Grate the cheddar.",
    "Beat the eggs in a small bowl.",
    "Set out chakalaka and mint yoghurt dressing to serve.",
    "Bring a large pot and whisk to the stovetop for pap (you’ll need water and a pinch of salt from the pantry)."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Make the pap: Bring salted water to a boil, whisk in maize meal gradually to avoid lumps, then lower heat and cook, stirring, until thick and smooth (10–15 minutes).",
    "Stir in butter and half the cheddar. Remove from heat and let cool 2–3 minutes, then quickly whisk in the beaten eggs.",
    "Spread the pap mixture into the greased baking dish, top with the remaining cheddar, and bake until set and golden at the edges (25–30 minutes).",
    "While pap bakes, place a small pan on the braai or stovetop with a knob of butter and gently cook the chopped onion until soft and lightly golden (5–7 minutes). Keep warm to spoon over pap when serving (optional).",
    "Braai the lamb chops over medium-hot coals, turning every 2–3 minutes, until nicely browned and cooked to your liking (about 8–12 minutes total for medium).",
    "Rest lamb chops on a tray, loosely covered, for 5–10 minutes.",
    "Warm the chakalaka in a small pot on the braai grid or stovetop until hot, stirring occasionally (3–5 minutes).",
    "Cut the pap tart into squares. Top with the sautéed onions if using.",
    "Serve lamb chops with a spoon of mint yoghurt dressing, pap tart squares, and warm chakalaka."
