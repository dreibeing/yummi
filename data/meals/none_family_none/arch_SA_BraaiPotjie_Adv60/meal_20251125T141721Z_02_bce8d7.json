  "name": "Braai Snoek with Mango Chutney Glaze, Fire Corn & Peppers, and Oven-Baked Potatoes",
  "description": "Whole snoek braaied with a glossy mango-chutney glaze, served with charred corn and peppers and crisp-skinned oven potatoes. A coastal South African feast built for the braai with an oven side.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 200°C (392°F).",
    "Scrub 6 medium potatoes; pat dry and prick each a few times with a fork.",
    "Shuck 6 ears of corn; trim silks. Halve 2 large bell peppers and remove seeds.",
    "Finely chop a small handful of parsley (about 1/4 cup).",
    "Mince 3 cloves garlic.",
    "In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup mango chutney, 3 tbsp melted butter, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tsp chilli flakes, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper to make the glaze.",
    "Pat 1 whole snoek dry; brush skin lightly with 1 tbsp olive oil and season both sides with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.",
    "Build a medium braai fire with steady coals for direct heat plus a cooler zone; clean and oil the grill grates."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Potatoes: Rub potatoes with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt. Place on a tray and bake 60–75 minutes until skins are crisp and centers tender. Keep warm.",
    "Corn & peppers: Just before braaing the fish, toss corn and pepper halves with 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt. Grill over medium coals, turning occasionally, 12–15 minutes until lightly charred and tender. Move to a warm side.",
    "Snoek setup: Place snoek skin-side down on a clean, oiled grid over medium heat (cooler side if flare-ups). Close the lid if your braai has one.",
    "Glaze and cook: After 5 minutes, brush the flesh generously with the chutney glaze. Continue cooking skin-side down 10–15 minutes, brushing twice more, until the fish flakes at the thickest part.",
    "Optional finish: For light caramelisation, flip briefly (30–60 seconds) flesh-side down over a cooler spot to avoid sticking.",
    "Rest and garnish: Slide snoek onto a tray. Brush with any remaining warm glaze and scatter parsley.",
    "Serve: Halve or quarter the baked potatoes. Serve with the charred corn and peppers alongside the glazed snoek."
