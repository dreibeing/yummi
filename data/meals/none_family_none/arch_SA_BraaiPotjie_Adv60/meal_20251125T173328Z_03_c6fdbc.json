  "cook_steps": [
    "Rub ribs all over with the dry rub.",
    "Place ribs meat-side up on the foil-lined tray; cover tightly with another sheet of foil.",

    "While ribs bake, light the outdoor grill for medium-high, two-zone heat (direct and indirect).",

    "Add garlic; cook 1 min. Add tomatoes and chopped apricot; season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper.",
    "Simmer smoor uncovered over gentle grill heat, stirring occasionally, 25–35 min until thick; move pot closer to or away from heat to maintain a steady simmer. Adjust salt and black pepper.",
    "Remove ribs from oven and discard foil. Brush a thin layer of glaze over both sides.",
    "Transfer ribs to the grill, bone-side down over indirect heat. Close lid and cook 10 min.",
    "Brush more glaze; move ribs briefly over direct heat to caramelize, 2–3 min per side, watching for flare-ups. Repeat glazing once more for a sticky finish.",
    "Toast bread rolls cut-side down over direct heat 1–2 min until charred at the edges.",
    "Rest ribs 5 min, then slice between bones. Serve with smoor and grilled rolls. Offer remaining glaze at the table."
