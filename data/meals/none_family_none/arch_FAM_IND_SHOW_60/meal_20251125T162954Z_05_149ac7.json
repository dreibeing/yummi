  "cook_steps": [
    "Fry onions for biryani: Heat 3 tbsp oil and 2 tbsp ghee in a wide pan over medium-high. Fry 3 of the sliced large onions with 1/2 tsp salt, stirring, until deep golden and crisp at edges (15–20 minutes). Remove half for layering; leave the rest in the pan.",
    "Parboil rice: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil with 1 tbsp salt, the bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. Add soaked rice; cook 5–6 minutes until 70% done. Drain; spread briefly to steam off.",
    "Start chicken base: In the onion pan, add the marinated chicken and 2 crushed garlic cloves. Sear 3–4 minutes per side until lightly colored. Turn heat to low; cook 5 minutes to start releasing juices. Turn off heat.",
    "Layer biryani (dum): Transfer chicken and its juices to a heavy oven-safe pot. Scatter half the reserved fried onions, half the remaining mint/coriander, and 4–5 halved chilies over chicken. Spread the parboiled rice on top. Drizzle saffron milk and 1 tbsp ghee over rice. Top with remaining fried onions and herbs.",
    "Seal and bake: Cover pot tightly with a lid (use foil under lid if loose). Bake at 180°C/350°F for 35–40 minutes. Rest 10 minutes before opening.",
    "Make mirch ka salan paste: In a dry pan, toast 1/3 cup peanuts and 2 tbsp sesame seeds over medium heat until fragrant (3–4 minutes). Add 1/2 cup water and blend to a smooth paste.",
    "Cook salan: In a saucepan, heat 2 tbsp oil. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds and 1 tsp cumin seeds; let them crackle. Add the reserved 1 large sliced onion; cook until golden. Stir in the peanut–sesame paste, 1 cup coconut milk, 2 tbsp tamarind chutney, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1 cup water. Add 6–8 halved chilies. Simmer gently 12–15 minutes until thick, adjusting water as needed. Salt to taste.",
    "Mix raita: Whisk 1 cup yoghurt with a pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp cumin. Fold in sliced cucumber and 2 tbsp chopped mint.",
    "Finish biryani: Gently fluff the top rice layer, then fold down into the chicken in two or three scoops to keep layers intact. Taste and adjust salt.",
    "Serve: Plate biryani with extra herbs on top. Ladle mirch ka salan alongside and add a spoon of raita."
