  "description": "A layered vegetable dum biryani finished under a tight seal for fragrant, fluffy rice, served with a bright kachumber salad and crisp oven-puffed poppadoms.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Rinse basmati rice under cold water until it runs clear; soak 30 minutes, then drain.",
    "Crush saffron lightly and soak in 1/4 cup warm water.",
    "Thinly slice 2 large onions; mince garlic; slice chilies.",
    "Cut vegetables: cube potatoes; slice carrots; dice bell peppers; measure peas.",
    "Rough-chop coriander and mint; cut cucumber, tomato, and red onion for kachumber.",
    "Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.",
    "Grease a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven with oil; line a baking tray for poppadoms."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Parboil rice: Bring a large pot of water to a boil with salt, bay leaves, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise. Add soaked rice and cook 5–6 minutes until 70% done; drain and spread to steam off.",
    "Make fried onions: Heat oil in a wide pan on medium-high. Fry sliced onions with a pinch of salt until deep golden and crisp at edges (12–15 minutes); remove half to a plate for topping.",
    "Build vegetable masala: In the same pan with remaining onions, add garlic and chilies; sauté 1 minute. Add potatoes and carrots; cook 4–5 minutes. Stir in bell peppers and peas, then add biryani mix and diced tomatoes; cook until thick and glossy (5–7 minutes). Season with salt and black pepper.",
    "Layer biryani: In the greased Dutch oven, spread half the parboiled rice. Top with all the vegetable masala, some coriander and mint, and a handful of fried onions. Cover with remaining rice. Drizzle saffron water evenly over the top and a little oil. Scatter remaining herbs and fried onions.",
    "Seal and bake (dum): Cover pot tightly with foil and a fitting lid. Bake 30–35 minutes until rice is fully tender and aromatic. Rest 10 minutes before opening.",
    "Make kachumber: Toss cucumber, tomato, and red onion with lemon juice, coriander, mint, salt, and black pepper. Chill until serving.",
    "Oven-puff poppadoms: Place poppadoms on the lined tray and bake 2–3 minutes, flipping once, until blistered and crisp.",
    "Serve: Gently fluff biryani, lifting from the sides to keep layers intact. Plate with kachumber and poppadoms."
