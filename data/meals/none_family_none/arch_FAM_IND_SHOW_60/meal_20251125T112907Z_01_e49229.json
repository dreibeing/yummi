  "name": "Saffron Chicken Dum Biryani with Cucumber Raita",
  "description": "A layered chicken biryani sealed and baked on dum with saffron milk, fried onions, and herbs, served with a cooling cucumber raita. Weekend showstopper with medium heat and classic Indian flavors.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Rinse basmati rice under cold water until it runs clear; soak 20 minutes, then drain.",
    "Warm milk slightly and crumble saffron into it; set aside to bloom.",
    "Slice onions thinly.",
    "Chop coriander and mint.",
    "Mince garlic.",
    "Cut cucumber into small dice for raita.",
    "In a bowl, combine yoghurt, lemon juice, salt, turmeric powder, garam masala, chili flakes, and minced garlic; add chicken thighs and coat well. Marinate 30–60 minutes refrigerated.",
    "Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.",
    "Mix flour with enough water to form a pliable rope for sealing the pot lid; cover to prevent drying."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add salt and a bay leaf. Add soaked basmati rice and cook until 70% done (grains still firm), about 5–6 minutes. Drain and spread to steam off.",
    "Heat ghee with a little canola oil in a heavy oven-safe pot over medium heat. Fry sliced onions, stirring, until deep golden and crisp at edges. Remove half to a plate for layering; leave the rest in the pot.",

    "Increase heat to medium-high. Add marinated chicken thighs and any marinade; sear 2–3 minutes per side until lightly browned.",
    "Reduce heat to medium. Cook chicken with lid ajar 8–10 minutes, stirring once, until just starting to release juices.",
    "Turn heat off. Scatter half the chopped mint and coriander over the chicken, then half the reserved fried onions.",
    "Layer par-cooked rice evenly over the chicken. Drizzle saffron milk over the rice and dot with a little ghee. Top with remaining fried onions and remaining herbs.",
    "Run the flour rope around the pot rim, press on the lid to seal. Transfer to oven and bake 35–40 minutes.",
    "Rest 10 minutes out of the oven, then break the seal. Gently fluff, lifting chicken and rice together to keep layers distinct.",
    "For the raita: In a bowl, mix yoghurt, diced cucumber, ground cumin, a pinch of salt, and chopped mint. Serve alongside the biryani."
