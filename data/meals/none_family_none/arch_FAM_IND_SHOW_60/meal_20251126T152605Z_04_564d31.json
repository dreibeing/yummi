  "name": "Punjabi Chole with Yogurt-Fermented Bhature and Pickled Onion",
  "description": "A festival-style North Indian chickpea curry simmered with warm spices, served with puffed, yogurt-fermented bhature and bright lemon-herb garnish. Set aside time to soak beans and rest the dough for a true weekend showstopper.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Pick through and rinse chickpeas; cover with plenty of water and soak 8–12 hours (overnight). Drain.",
    "Finely chop onions and garlic. Roughly chop coriander. Cut lemon into wedges.",
    "Measure spices for chole: cumin seeds, ground cumin, coriander, turmeric powder, garam masala, chili flakes, bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, black pepper, salt.",
    "Make bhature dough: In a bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt, yoghurt, 1 tablespoon oil, and enough water to form a soft, slightly tacky dough. Knead 8–10 minutes until smooth.",
    "Lightly oil the dough, cover, and rest in a warm spot 2–3 hours to gently ferment and relax.",
    "Open diced tomatoes and set aside. Line a tray with paper towels for fried bread. Set out pickled onions and mango chutney."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Cook chickpeas: Add soaked chickpeas to a pot with fresh water to cover by 5 cm and a pinch of salt. Simmer on the stovetop until tender (60–90 minutes), or pressure cook until soft. Drain and reserve 1 cup cooking liquid.",
    "Start the chole masala: Heat 3 tablespoons oil or ghee in a wide pot. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, cinnamon, and cloves; toast 30–45 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Add onions and a pinch of salt; cook on medium, stirring, until deep golden brown, 10–15 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute.",
    "Stir in ground cumin, coriander, turmeric powder, chili flakes, and black pepper; toast 30 seconds.",
    "Add diced tomatoes; cook down 6–8 minutes until thick and glossy.",
    "Add cooked chickpeas, 1/2 cup reserved cooking liquid, and garam masala. Simmer 15–20 minutes, mashing a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken. Adjust salt and heat; add more liquid if needed for a saucy consistency.",
    "Finish chole: Stir in chopped coriander and a squeeze of lemon. Keep warm on low.",
    "Fry bhature: Divide rested dough into 10–12 balls. Roll each to a 15–18 cm round, 3–4 mm thick. Heat 4–5 cm oil in a deep pan to 180–185°C. Fry one round at a time, gently pressing to help puff; flip once golden (30–45 seconds per side). Drain on paper towels. Repeat.",
    "Serve: Spoon chole into a serving bowl. Garnish with extra coriander and lemon wedges. Serve hot bhature alongside with pickled onions and mango chutney."
