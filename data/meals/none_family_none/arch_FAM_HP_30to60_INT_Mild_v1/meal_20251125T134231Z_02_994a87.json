  "cook_steps": [
    "Roast vegetables: In a bowl, toss onions, bell peppers, and zucchini with 1 tbsp olive oil, a big pinch of salt, and black pepper. Spread on the preheated sheet pan and roast 18–22 minutes, tossing once, until tender and lightly charred.",
    "Season chicken: In a large bowl, combine 2 tbsp olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, lemon zest, 1/2 tsp salt, and a few grinds of black pepper. Add chicken and coat well.",
    "Sear chicken: Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Sear chicken 3–4 minutes per side until browned.",

    "Cook quinoa: While chicken cooks, bring 3 cups water and 1/2 tsp salt to a boil in a saucepan. Stir in rinsed quinoa, reduce to low, cover, and simmer 14–16 minutes until water is absorbed. Remove from heat, cover, and rest 5 minutes.",
    "Finish quinoa: Fluff quinoa with a fork. Fold in chickpeas, 1 tbsp lemon juice, half the chopped parsley, a pinch of salt, and black pepper to taste. Warm over low heat 1–2 minutes if needed.",
    "Plate: Spoon chickpea quinoa onto plates, top with sliced chicken, add roasted vegetables on the side, and finish with remaining parsley and extra lemon juice to taste."
