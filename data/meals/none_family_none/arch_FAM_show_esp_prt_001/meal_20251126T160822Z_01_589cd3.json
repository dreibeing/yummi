  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Pat the T-bone steak dry. Season all over with salt, black pepper, and paprika. Rub with 1 tbsp olive oil and let sit at room temperature 45–60 minutes.",
    "Preheat the outdoor grill to high heat with a hot and a cooler zone. If using oven for bread, preheat to 220°C (430°F).",
    "Rinse and dry the padron peppers. Toss with 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt.",
    "Grate or finely chop the tomatoes into a bowl. Grate 1 garlic clove into the tomatoes, add 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt; stir and set aside.",
    "Cut 8 slices of sourdough bread (about 1.5 cm thick). Peel 2 garlic cloves to rub on toast later.",
    "Halve the lemon. Roughly chop parsley."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Grill the steak over the hot zone 2–3 minutes per side to develop a deep crust, searing the fat edge briefly. Move to the cooler zone and cook to your target doneness (approx. 50–55°C/122–131°F for medium-rare).",
    "Transfer the steak to a board, squeeze a little lemon over, and rest 10 minutes.",
    "Grill the padron peppers in a grill basket or directly over high heat, turning until blistered and tender, 5–7 minutes. Finish with a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt.",
    "Toast the sourdough bread on the grill grates (or on a tray in the oven) until crisp at the edges, 2–3 minutes per side.",
    "Rub the hot toast lightly with the peeled garlic cloves, spoon on the tomato mixture, drizzle with a little olive oil, and sprinkle with salt.",
    "Slice the steak from the bone and cut into thick slices. Plate the steak with any resting juices, scatter parsley, and serve alongside the blistered peppers and pan con tomate."
