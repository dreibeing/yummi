  "name": "Chicken & Chorizo Paella with Saffron and Peppers",
  "description": "A family-sized Spanish paella layered with golden chicken, smoky chorizo, saffron rice, and sweet peppers, finished with lemon and parsley. A centerpiece weekend cook that rewards patience with deep flavor and a crisp socarrat.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Warm 5 cups chicken stock; crumble a pinch of saffron into it to infuse.",
    "Slice chorizo into 0.5 cm rounds.",
    "Pat dry chicken thighs and season all sides with salt and black pepper.",
    "Dice onions; mince garlic.",
    "Core and slice bell peppers into strips.",
    "Chop parsley; cut lemon into wedges.",
    "If using an outdoor grill, preheat it for medium, even heat. If using stovetop, place a wide paella pan or large skillet over medium heat."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Heat olive oil in the pan. Add chorizo and cook 3–4 minutes until lightly crisp; remove to a bowl, leaving the rendered oil.",
    "Brown chicken thighs skin-side down 6–8 minutes, flip and brown 3–4 minutes more; remove to a plate (they will finish in the rice).",
    "Add onions and bell peppers with a pinch of salt; cook 6–8 minutes until softened.",
    "Stir in garlic and paprika; cook 30 seconds until fragrant.",
    "Add diced tomatoes; cook 2–3 minutes to reduce excess liquid.",

    "Pour in white wine; simmer 1–2 minutes until mostly absorbed.",
    "Pour in the hot saffron chicken stock and add bay leaves. Stir once to distribute rice evenly, then do not stir again.",
    "Nestle chicken thighs and chorizo into the rice. Adjust heat to maintain a steady simmer. Cook uncovered 18–20 minutes, rotating the pan occasionally for even cooking.",
    "Scatter peas over the top; cook 5–8 minutes more until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (add a splash of water if needed).",
    "For socarrat: increase heat to medium-high for 1–2 minutes until you hear gentle crackling; stop before burning.",
    "Remove from heat; tent loosely and rest 5–10 minutes. Discard bay leaves, garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges."
