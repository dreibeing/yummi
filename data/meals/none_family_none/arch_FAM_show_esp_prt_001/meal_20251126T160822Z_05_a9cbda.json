  "description": "Showstopper family feast of juicy grilled picanha over garlicky Spanish rice with smoky charred peppers and lemon-parsley finish.",
  "servings": "Serves 4–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Pat dry the picanha steak and score the fat cap in a crosshatch (shallow cuts).",
    "Season the picanha all over with salt, black pepper, and a light dusting of paprika.",
    "Rinse the spanish rice under cold water until it runs mostly clear; drain well.",
    "Slice bell peppers into thick strips; peel and slice onions; peel and finely chop garlic.",
    "Roughly chop parsley; cut the lemon into wedges (reserve a little zest if desired).",
    "Preheat Outdoor Grill to medium-high. Set oven to 220°C/425°F (for finishing peppers if needed).",
    "Set a wide stovetop pot or deep skillet for rice over medium heat."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Start peppers: Toss bell peppers and onions with olive oil, salt, and a pinch of paprika. Place on the grill in a grill basket or on a tray; cook until lightly charred and tender (10–15 minutes), turning occasionally. If needed, transfer to the oven to finish softening.",
    "Render and sear picanha: Place picanha fat-side down on the grill over indirect-to-medium heat to render the fat (6–8 minutes), moving to avoid flare-ups. Flip and grill to desired doneness (approx. 8–12 minutes more for medium-rare), then rest on a board 10 minutes.",
    "Start rice base: Add olive oil to the hot pot. Sauté onions with a pinch of salt until translucent (5 minutes). Stir in garlic and a pinch of paprika for 30 seconds.",
    "Toast and simmer rice: Add drained spanish rice; stir 1–2 minutes to coat. Pour in white wine and simmer until mostly absorbed. Add chicken stock and bay leaves, bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed (15–18 minutes).",
    "Finish sides: Toss charred peppers and onions with a squeeze of lemon and half the chopped parsley. Keep warm.",
    "Finish rice: Remove bay leaves; rest covered 5 minutes, then fluff. Stir in remaining parsley and a small squeeze of lemon (optional zest to taste).",
    "Slice and serve: Slice picanha against the grain. Serve over the garlic Spanish rice with the charred peppers alongside. Finish with a light drizzle of olive oil and lemon wedges."
