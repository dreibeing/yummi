    "Preheat oven to 230°C (450°F).",

    "Cut lemon into wedges.",
    "Set out a large frying pan for potatoes, a wide sauté pan for the hake mix, and a baking tray for peppers."

  "cook_steps": [
    "In a medium pot, add smoked hake, bay leaves, and enough water to cover; bring to a gentle simmer on the stovetop for 6–8 minutes until just flaky. Drain, discard bay leaves, and flake the fish, removing any skin/bones.",
    "Heat a large frying pan with 80 ml olive oil over medium-high heat. Fry dried potato matchsticks in batches until golden and crisp (6–8 minutes per batch). Transfer to a paper towel–lined tray and season with salt. Keep warm.",
    "While frying potatoes, spread padron peppers on a baking tray, season with salt, and roast in the oven for 8–10 minutes until blistered, turning once. Hold in the switched-off oven to keep warm.",
    "In a wide sauté pan, add 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Cook sliced onions with a pinch of salt until soft and pale golden, 8–10 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook 1 minute.",
    "Add flaked smoked hake to the onions and warm through for 2–3 minutes, gently folding.",
    "Reduce heat to low. Pour in beaten eggs and stir slowly with a spatula until just creamy and softly set, 2–3 minutes (do not scramble dry).",
    "Fold in most of the crispy potatoes (reserve a handful for topping), chopped parsley, and most of the olives. Adjust salt and black pepper, and add a small drizzle of olive oil if needed.",
    "Plate the à Brás. Top with reserved crispy potatoes and remaining olives. Serve with blistered padron peppers and lemon wedges on the side for squeezing."
