  "description": "A showstopping roast leg of lamb marinated with garlic, lemon, paprika, and bay, served over Spanish-style sliced potatoes and onions that soak up the pan juices.",
  "servings": "Serves 5–6",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F).",
    "Peel and thinly slice the onions.",
    "Peel and slice the potatoes into 5–7 mm rounds.",
    "Peel and crush the garlic.",
    "Halve and juice the lemon; reserve the squeezed halves.",
    "In a bowl, mix garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, paprika, oregano, salt, black pepper, and white wine to make a marinade.",
    "Pat the leg of lamb dry with paper towels.",
    "Toss potatoes and onions with a little olive oil, salt, black pepper, and a pinch of paprika.",
    "Lightly oil a large roasting pan and spread the potatoes and onions evenly.",

  "cook_steps": [
    "Rub the leg of lamb thoroughly with the marinade, tucking bay leaves and the squeezed lemon halves under and around the meat.",
    "Heat a large stove-safe roasting pan or skillet over medium-high heat and sear the leg of lamb on all sides until browned (about 8–10 minutes total).",
    "Set the seared lamb on top of the potato-onion bed in the roasting pan, pouring any marinade and pan juices over everything.",
    "Roast at 200°C (390°F) for 20 minutes to develop color.",
    "Reduce oven to 170°C (340°F) and continue roasting 60–80 minutes, basting the lamb and potatoes with pan juices every 20 minutes. Add a splash of water if the pan looks dry.",
    "Check doneness: for medium, aim for 60–63°C (140–145°F) in the thickest part. Roast longer for more doneness as preferred.",
    "Rest the lamb on a board, loosely covered, for 15–20 minutes.",
    "While the lamb rests, return the potatoes to the oven for 10 minutes to crisp edges and reduce the juices slightly.",
    "Slice the lamb across the grain. Scatter chopped parsley over the potatoes and onions.",
    "Serve sliced lamb over the panadera potatoes, spooning pan juices on top."
