  "servings": "Serves 4–5",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Pat dry the butterflied chicken with paper towels.",

    "Rub marinade all over the chicken (under the skin where possible). Cover and marinate 30–60 minutes in the fridge.",
    "Peel (optional) and cut potatoes into 3–4 cm chunks. Rinse to remove surface starch.",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil for potatoes. Preheat oven to 220°C (425°F) with a large roasting tray inside.",
    "Toss padron peppers with 1 tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt in a bowl; set aside.",

    "Place marinated butterflied chicken skin-side up over indirect heat on the grill. Close lid and cook 35–45 minutes, maintaining steady medium heat.",
    "Move chicken to direct heat, skin-side down, and char 3–5 minutes to crisp. Flip and brush with a little extra peri-peri sauce if desired; cook until juices run clear and thickest part reaches doneness.",
    "While chicken finishes, blister padron peppers: place a cast-iron pan on the grill or use a hot stovetop pan. Add peppers and cook 3–5 minutes, tossing, until blistered. Season with a pinch of salt.",
    "Rest chicken 10 minutes. Scatter chopped parsley over potatoes.",
    "Carve chicken. Serve with lemon wedges, crispy lemon potatoes, and blistered padron peppers."
