  "description": "A bistro-style, low-sodium skillet beef and mushroom cream sauce served over fettuccine, with bright roasted lemon green beans. Mild flavors and weeknight-friendly steps.",
  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).",
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta (no added salt).",
    "Trim green beans and pat dry.",

    "Mince garlic; chop parsley.",
    "Zest the lemon, then cut it into wedges.",
    "Thinly slice the beef across the grain."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "Roast the beans: On a sheet pan, toss green beans with 1 tbsp olive oil, a pinch of black pepper, and half the lemon zest. Spread out and roast 12–15 minutes until tender with lightly browned spots. Squeeze 1–2 lemon wedges over before serving.",
    "Cook pasta: Add fettuccine to boiling water and cook until al dente per package time. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain.",
    "Sear beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium-high. Add beef in a single layer; sear 1–2 minutes per side until just browned. Transfer to a plate.",
    "Sauté veg: Reduce heat to medium. Add remaining 1 tbsp olive oil and the onion; cook 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook 5–6 minutes until they release moisture and brown. Stir in garlic for 30 seconds.",
    "Make roux: Add remaining 1 tbsp butter and sprinkle in flour. Stir 1 minute to coat.",
    "Deglaze and simmer: Pour in white wine, scraping up browned bits. Add mushroom stock and remaining lemon zest; simmer 3–4 minutes until slightly thickened.",
    "Finish sauce: Stir in mustard and creme fraiche. Return beef and any juices to the pan; simmer 1–2 minutes until just cooked through. Season with black pepper and a squeeze of lemon to taste.",
    "Serve: Toss drained fettuccine with a splash of reserved pasta water and a ladle of sauce, or plate pasta and spoon beef-mushroom sauce over the top. Garnish with parsley. Serve with roasted lemon green beans."
