    "Roast vegetables: On a sheet pan, toss green beans and baby carrots with 1 tablespoon olive oil, a big pinch of black pepper, and a pinch of garlic flakes if using. Roast until tender and lightly browned, 15–20 minutes, tossing once halfway.",
    "Sear pork: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high. Sear pork chops 2–3 minutes per side until well browned.",
    "Finish pork (optional oven finish): If chops are thick, transfer skillet to the oven for 5–7 minutes until cooked through (internal temp about 145°F). Transfer chops to a plate; tent with foil.",

    "Deglaze: Add 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar; simmer 30 seconds, scraping up browned bits. Add 3/4 cup vegetable stock and chopped sage; simmer 3–5 minutes until slightly thickened and glossy. Season with black pepper to taste. Return pork chops to the pan to warm 1 minute; remove from heat.",
    "Mash potatoes: Drain cooked potatoes well. Return to pot; add 2 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup milk. Mash until smooth and creamy. Add black pepper to taste.",
    "Serve: Plate mashed potatoes, roasted green beans and carrots, and pork chops. Spoon apple-sage sauce over the chops."
