  "cook_steps": [
    "Cook quinoa: In a small pot, combine rinsed quinoa with 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce to low, cover, and cook 15 minutes. Fluff and let cool slightly.",
    "Start potatoes: Place potatoes and 2 garlic cloves in a large pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a gentle boil and cook until tender, 12–15 minutes.",
    "Make meatloaf mix: In a bowl, combine 1.25 lb turkey, 1 cup cooked quinoa (reserve any extra), 1/2 of the chopped onion, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 egg, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp chopped parsley, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Mix gently until just combined.",
    "Form and bake: Shape mixture into 8 equal mini loaves on a parchment-lined sheet. Bake until cooked through (165°F/74°C), 18–22 minutes.",
    "Gravy base: In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tbsp butter with 1 tsp olive oil. Add remaining onion and sliced mushrooms; cook, stirring, until mushrooms are browned and moisture evaporates, 6–8 minutes.",
    "Make gravy: Sprinkle 1 tbsp flour over mushrooms; cook 1 minute, stirring. Deglaze with white wine and simmer 1–2 minutes. Whisk in mushroom stock, add 1/2 tsp thyme and a pinch of black pepper, and simmer until glossy and slightly thick, 3–5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.",
    "Green beans: While gravy simmers, place green beans in a sauté pan with 1/4 cup water and 1 tsp olive oil. Cover and steam-sauté over medium heat until crisp-tender, 4–6 minutes. Finish with black pepper.",
    "Mash potatoes: Drain potatoes and garlic well. Return to pot over low heat for 30 seconds to evaporate excess moisture. Add 3 tbsp butter and 1/3–1/2 cup warm milk; mash until smooth. Season with black pepper.",
    "Finish: Spoon mushroom-thyme gravy over baked mini meatloaves. Serve with garlic mash and green beans. Sprinkle remaining parsley over the top."
