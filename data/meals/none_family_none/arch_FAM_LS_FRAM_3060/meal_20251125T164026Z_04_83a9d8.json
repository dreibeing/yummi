  "description": "Crisp-skinned duck finished with a bright orange pan sauce, served alongside rosemary-roasted potatoes and gently braised red cabbage with apple. Built for low-sodium family dining with mild, comforting flavors.",
  "servings": "Serves 4",
  "prep_steps": [
    "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).",
    "Scrub potatoes and cut into 1-inch chunks.",
    "Thinly slice red cabbage; thinly slice onion; core and thinly slice apple.",
    "Finely chop rosemary (if whole sprigs).",
    "Pat duck dry; lightly score skin in a crosshatch (do not cut into the meat).",
    "Zest 1 orange; juice both oranges into a bowl (about 1/2–3/4 cup).",
    "Stir cornflour with water to make a smooth slurry.",
    "Set out black pepper, olive oil, butter, and white wine."
  ],
  "cook_steps": [
    "On a sheet pan, toss potatoes with 1.5 tbsp olive oil, half the rosemary, and a few grinds of black pepper. Roast 25–35 minutes, turning once, until golden and tender.",
    "Start the cabbage: In a wide pot over medium heat, add 1 tbsp olive oil. Cook onion 3–4 minutes until softened. Add cabbage and apple; cook 5 minutes, stirring.",
    "Add apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup water to the cabbage. Cover and simmer on low, stirring occasionally, 12–15 minutes until tender with a slight bite. Season with black pepper to taste and keep warm.",
    "Cook the duck: Place duck skin-side down in a cold, oven-safe skillet. Turn heat to medium. Cook 8–10 minutes to render fat and deeply crisp the skin. Spoon off excess fat as needed (reserve 1 tbsp in pan).",
    "Flip duck and cook 1–2 minutes. Transfer skillet to the oven (same 425°F) and roast 4–7 minutes depending on thickness for medium doneness. Rest duck on a board, skin-side up, 5 minutes.",
    "Make the orange pan sauce: Return skillet to medium heat with 1 tbsp reserved duck fat (or 1 tsp olive oil if needed). Add orange zest and white wine; simmer 1–2 minutes, scraping browned bits.",
    "Add orange juice and honey; simmer 2–3 minutes to reduce slightly. Whisk in the cornflour slurry; simmer 30–60 seconds until glossy. Off heat, whisk in butter to finish. Grind in black pepper.",
    "Slice duck. Plate with rosemary potatoes and braised cabbage. Spoon orange sauce over duck."
