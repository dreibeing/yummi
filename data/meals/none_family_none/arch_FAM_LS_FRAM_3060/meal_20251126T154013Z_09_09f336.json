  "description": "A family-friendly, low-sodium take on a French bistro classic: tender beef, mushrooms, and carrots in a wine–herb sauce, served with olive oil mashed potatoes. Comforting and mild, finished in the oven for rich flavor without added salt.",

  "cook_steps": [
    "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.",
    "Brown half the beef in a single layer, 3–4 minutes per side; transfer to a plate. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and brown the remaining beef; transfer to the plate.",
    "Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan. Sauté onion and carrots for 4–5 minutes until lightly browned. Add mushrooms and cook 3 minutes more. Stir in garlic for 30 seconds.",
    "Clear a space in the pan; add tomato paste and cook 1 minute to darken. Pour in white wine, scraping up browned bits.",
    "Return beef and juices to the pan. Add water, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover, and transfer to the oven. Bake 25–30 minutes until beef is tender.",
    "While the stew braises, bring the potatoes to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer and cook 12–15 minutes until very tender.",
    "Reserve 1 cup potato cooking water, then drain. Mash potatoes with 3 tablespoons olive oil, splashing in reserved water until creamy. Season with black pepper to taste and stir in half the parsley.",
    "Remove the stew from the oven. If sauce needs thickening, simmer uncovered on the stovetop for 3–5 minutes until glossy. Stir in remaining parsley and a few grinds of black pepper.",
    "Serve stew over (or alongside) the olive oil mash."
