  "cook_steps": [
    "Cook rice: Add rinsed jasmine rice and 3 cups water to a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to low, cover, and simmer 12–15 minutes until tender. Rest covered 5 minutes, fluff with a fork.",
    "Vegetables (stovetop): Heat 1 tsp canola oil in a large pan over medium. Add carrot slices and bok choy stems with a pinch of salt; sauté 2–3 minutes. Add garlic and bok choy leaves; cook 1–2 minutes until just tender. Transfer to a plate.",
