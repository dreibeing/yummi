# Phase 1 — Mobile App PRD (Concise)

> Audience: GPT‑5 Codex agent + engineering
> Goal: Ship a minimal, publishable mobile app (iOS/Android) with auth, subscription, and “Send to Retailer” handoff that triggers a Woolworths basket fill POC.

## 1) Scope (Phase 1)

* **Auth**: Sign in with Apple (iOS), Google, Facebook (social login; OIDC).
* **Subscription**: In‑app purchases via **RevenueCat** (monthly + annual; free trial). Entitlement gates access to “Retailer handoff.”
* **Planner Placeholder**: Temporary mock that produces a shopping list (items map to real Woolworths products). ThinSlice planner will replace later.
* **Retailer Handoff**: Button to initiate a secure, user‑side basket fill (Chrome extension POC) or server runner (Playwright) for demo.
* **Export**: Share shopping list as CSV/PDF for manual workflows.

## 2) Out of Scope (Phase 1)

* In‑app grocery payment/checkout (happens on retailer site).
* Advanced planning UX, nutrition/macros, multi‑user households.

## 3) Platforms & Tech

* **Mobile client**: React Native + Expo Router (TypeScript).
* **Auth**: Supabase Auth or Auth0 (supports Apple/Google/Facebook; with Sign in with Apple compliance on iOS).
* **Subscriptions**: RevenueCat SDK (entitlements: `free`, `pro`).
* **Backend (MVP)**: Serverless functions (Node/TS on Vercel/Fly/Cloud Functions) for analytics webhooks and optional runner trigger.
* **Analytics**: Sentry + GA4/Amplitude (events below).

## 4) Core User Stories & Acceptance

**US‑01 Auth**: As a user I can sign in with Apple/Google/Facebook.

* *Acceptance*: Successful OIDC login; profile stored; Sign in with Apple shown on iOS; logout works.

**US‑02 Paywall**: As a user I can start a trial/subscribe; app recognizes entitlement.

* *Acceptance*: RevenueCat entitlements unlock the “Retailer handoff” screen; restore purchases works; sandbox tested.

**US‑03 Create Plan (Placeholder)**: As a user I input counts for breakfasts/lunches/dinners and receive a list of items that map to real Woolworths products (URLs/SKUs).

* *Acceptance*: List renders with images, quantities, and total item count; export to CSV/PDF.

**US‑04 Retailer Handoff**: As a user I tap “Send to Woolworths,” authenticate in the browser, and my basket is filled for approval/payment.

* *Acceptance*: For a 50‑item test list, ≥95% items added with correct quantities; cart opens successfully.

## 5) Events (Analytics)

* `app_open`, `login_success`, `paywall_view`, `subscribe_success`, `plan_created_placeholder`, `handoff_started`, `basket_fill_success`, `basket_fill_partial`, `handoff_error`.

## 6) Non‑Functional

* Warm start ≤2s, cold start ≤5s.
* Crash‑free ≥99.5% on beta cohort.
* Accessibility labels; dynamic type; basic localization ready (units/currency abstractions).

## 7) Deliverables

* iOS TestFlight + Android Internal Test builds.
* RevenueCat products live (trial + monthly + annual).
* Minimal Privacy Policy + Terms + Support links.
* README with quickstart and sample JSON for item list.

## 8) Definition of Done (Phase 1)

* Auth + subscription flows pass QA on iOS/Android.
* Handoff fills 50‑item basket on Woolworths (POC route) within the performance target below.
* CSV/PDF export works.
* Store listing drafts prepared.

## 9) Performance Target (Handoff)

* 50 items in **≤30 seconds** (extension XHR path, batched).
* 100 items in **≤60 seconds** (with graceful degradation).
* Progress UI with per‑item success/fail counts.
