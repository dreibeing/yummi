Chargebacks

If a card chargeback happens on a wallet top-up, link it to the correct user and pull the same amount out of their wallet.

If that makes their balance go below zero, let it go negative and block all new spending until they add funds again.

Keep the account authenticated and log who/when/device for evidence.

Refunds (user-requested)

Users can refund any unused wallet balance back to their original payment method.

Keep it simple and fast for the user, but track approvals.

Allow only a limited number of refunds per user over a set period (e.g., a few times per quarter). If they exceed this or show patterns of abuse, flag the account and restrict or suspend service.

Abuse/Suspicion

If behavior looks suspicious (e.g., repeated refunds/chargebacks), mark the account, require manual review, and pause access until cleared.

Spending rule

No new debits if the user’s wallet is negative—only top-ups are allowed until the balance is back to zero or above.
